This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol QUIC provides applications with flow-controlled streams for structured communication, low latency connection establishment, and network path migration. QUIC includes security measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a range of deployment circumstances. Accompanying documents describe the integration of TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary congestion control algorithm. QUIC is a connection-oriented protocol that creates a stateful interaction between a client and server.The QUIC handshake combines negotiation of cryptographic and transport parameters.Endpoints communicate in QUIC by exchanging QUIC packets. Most packets contain frames, which carry control information and application data between endpoints. QUIC authenticates the entirety of each packet and encrypts as much of each packet as is practical. Application protocols exchange information over a QUIC connection via streams, which are ordered sequences of bytes. Two types of streams can be created: bidirectional streams, which allow both endpoints to send data; and unidirectional streams, which allow a single endpoint to send data. A credit-based scheme is used to limit stream creation and to bound the amount of data that can be sent. QUIC connections are not strictly bound to a single network path. Connection migration uses connection identifiers to allow connections to transfer to a new network path. Only clients are able to migrate in this version of QUIC. This design also allows connections to continue after changes in network topology or address mappings, such as might be caused by NAT rebinding. Once established, multiple options are provided for connection termination. Applications can manage a graceful shutdown, endpoints can negotiate a timeout period, errors can cause immediate connection teardown, and a stateless mechanism provides for termination of connections after one endpoint has lost state.
